# hello-world
Hi :) I taught myself how to code basic HTML in elementary school, when my dad would ground me. I sat around on Xanga creating layouts, codes, and other funk. In middle school, I graduated to working on Myspace layouts with the introduction of third-party integrations. In high school, I actually spent most of my time in Leadership/Student Government. In college, I had A LOT of fun. Now, here we are. Back to it.
